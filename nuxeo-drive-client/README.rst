Nuxeo Drive Client is a Python daemon that looks for changes
on the local machine filesystem in a specific folder and on a
remote workspace on the Nuxeo server using the Content Automation
HTTP API and propagate those changes one way of the other.

To install the dev dependencies and tools:

::
    sudo pip install -r dev-requirements
